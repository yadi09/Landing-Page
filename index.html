                <h3>Admin Page</h3>
                <p>
                    The Admin Page serves as the central hub for managing 
                    all student-related information within the LaptopGuard system. 
                    Here, administrators have complete control over adding, updating, 
                    and deleting student records. The page provides a streamlined view 
                    of all registered students, enabling easy access to student profiles, 
                    their associated laptop images, and the check-in/check-out logs. 
                    The admin can register new students by entering details such as the student's 
                    name, ID, year, department, and gender. Additionally, 
                    the admin can update existing student records with new 
                    information or remove them from the system if necessary. 
                    This page also allows for the bulk deletion of multiple students, 
                    further simplifying student management. The layout is intuitive, 
                    designed to ensure efficient oversight, and helps prevent unauthorized 
                    access by ensuring only admin-level users can access the functionalities provided.

                <h3>library check in/out page</h3>
                <p>
                    The Library Check-In/Out Page allows students to record their entry 
                    and exit times from the library. When a student checks in, the system 
                    logs the timestamp, initiating a record of the student's total time spent 
                    in the library. Upon check-out, the system calculates the duration of the 
                    student's library visit and updates their total library time accordingly. 
                    This feature is essential for tracking how long students spend in the library, 
                    a critical factor in managing laptop security. The page displays each student’s 
                    current status (checked in or out) and updates dynamically. This ensures real-time 
                    monitoring of all students inside the library, providing security personnel 
                    with an up-to-date record of who is inside the library at any given time. 
                    The page also has user-friendly prompts and responsive design for seamless usage on different devices.

                <h3>Exit check in/out Page</h3>
                <p>
                    The Exit Check-In/Out Page records when students leave the library 
                    with their laptops. Before students can exit, they are required to 
                    verify their identity and ownership of their laptop. 
                    The security personnel will manually match the stored laptop images 
                    with the actual laptop, ensuring that students do not leave with someone else’s laptop. 
                    The system logs each exit event, keeping track of the time the 
                    student leaves and linking it to the library check-in time to complete 
                    the overall record of the student's library usage. This page plays a crucial 
                    role in the security of laptops by preventing unauthorized exits with 
                    unverified laptops. It further supports laptop recovery in case of any 
                    disputes over ownership, thanks to the stored visual record of the laptops.

            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                LaptopGuard is an innovative system designed to tackle the problem of laptop 
                theft in university libraries, first identified at Kotebe University, 
                where students often leave their laptops unattended while taking breaks, 
                making them vulnerable to theft. The system allows institutions to track and secure laptops
                by tying each laptop to a specific student through a registration process that includes 
                uploading images of the laptop. When students check into the library, their presence is logged,
                and when they leave, security personnel manually verify that the laptop matches the one on file.
                This verification process, combined with digital record-keeping, reduces the risk of laptop theft or loss. 
                LaptopGuard features a comprehensive admin interface for managing student profiles, updating laptop images, 
                and tracking library logs. The system’s responsive design makes it accessible on various devices, 
                ensuring ease of use for both students and administrators. By integrating technology and manual processes, 
                LaptopGuard offers a practical solution to a real-world problem, enhancing security and providing 
                peace of mind to students and institutions alike. <a href="Demo.html" target="_blank">Demo Video</a>.
